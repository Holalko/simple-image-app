* NOTE: You are free to use any preprocessor you wish, or write raw CSS. Bonus points for an explanation of your choice.
  * used styled-components - not my favorite, but felt easiest to get the job done


## Part B
* Consume this public API @ https://aukro.cz/backend/api/homepage to retrieve a list of photos
    * done
* Display random 4 photos in the HTML + CSS layout created in step A, sticking to the layout, placing data where it fits, responsive.
  * I simulated the randomization by using the random 4 photos from the API
* Toggle switch - while enabled, turns all the visible photos to be grayscale.
  * done 
* Button “Fetch New Photos” will display a new set of random 4 photos.
  * done 
* Use React framework
  * done 
* Dockerization & hot reload inside Docker is a Bonus.
